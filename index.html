        <h2>Dear Papa,</h2>

        <p>
            As this New Year begins, I want to thank you
            for your endless sacrifices, guidance,
            and love that have shaped my life.
        </p>

        <p>
            You are my strength, my inspiration,
            and my greatest teacher.
            Your values and hard work motivate me
            every single day.
        </p>

        <p>
            May this New Year bring you
            excellent health, peace,
            happiness, and success.
            I promise to work hard
            and always make you proud.
        </p>
